## spec.provider

This section covers parameters of the AWS Cloud Provider.

[Review these fields in the code.](https://github.com/aws/karpenter/blob{{< githubRelRef >}}pkg/cloudprovider/aws/apis/v1alpha1/provider.go)

### InstanceProfile
An `InstanceProfile` is a way to pass a single IAM role to an EC2 instance. Karpenter will not create one automatically.
A default profile may be specified on the controller, allowing it to be omitted here. If not specified as either a default
or on the controller, node provisioning will fail.

```
spec:
  provider:
    instanceProfile: MyInstanceProfile
```

### LaunchTemplate

A launch template is a set of configuration values sufficient for launching an EC2 instance (e.g., AMI, storage spec).

A custom launch template is specified by name. If none is specified, Karpenter will automatically create a launch template.

Review the [Launch Template documentation](../launch-templates/) to learn how to create a custom one.

```
spec:
  provider:
    launchTemplate: MyLaunchTemplate
```

### SubnetSelector

Karpenter discovers subnets using [AWS tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html).

Subnets may be specified by any AWS tag, including `Name`. Selecting tag values using wildcards ("\*") is supported.

Subnet IDs may be specified by using the key `aws-ids` and then passing the IDs as a comma-separated string value.

When launching nodes, Karpenter automatically chooses a subnet that matches the desired zone. If multiple subnets exist for a zone, the one with the most available IP addresses will be used.

**Examples**

Select all subnets with a specified tag:
```
  subnetSelector:
    karpenter.sh/discovery/MyClusterName: '*'
```

Select subnets by name:
```
  subnetSelector:
    Name: my-subnet
```

Select subnets by an arbitrary AWS tag key/value pair:
```
  subnetSelector:
    MySubnetTag: value
```

Select subnets using wildcards:
```
  subnetSelector:
    Name: "*Public*"

```

Specify subnets explicitly by ID:
```yaml
  subnetSelector:
    aws-ids: "subnet-09fa4a0a8f233a921,subnet-0471ca205b8a129ae"
```


### SecurityGroupSelector

The security group of an instance is comparable to a set of firewall rules.

EKS creates at least two security groups by default, [review the documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html) for more info.

Security groups may be specified by any AWS tag, including "Name". Selecting tags using wildcards ("*") is supported.

‼️ When launching nodes, Karpenter uses all of the security groups that match the selector. If multiple security groups with the tag `karpenter.sh/discovery/MyClusterName` match the selector, this may result in failures using the AWS Load Balancer controller. The Load Balancer controller only supports a single security group having that tag key. See this [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/issues/2367) for more details.

To verify if this restriction affects you, run the following commands.
```bash
CLUSTER_VPC_ID="$(aws eks describe-cluster --name $CLUSTER_NAME --query cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.vpcId --output text)"

aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$CLUSTER_VPC_ID Name=tag-key,Values=karpenter.sh/discovery/$CLUSTER_NAME --query 'SecurityGroups[].[GroupName]' --output text
```

If multiple securityGroups are printed, you will need a more targeted securityGroupSelector.

**Examples**

Select all security groups with a specified tag:
```
spec:
  provider:
    securityGroupSelector:
      karpenter.sh/discovery/MyClusterName: '*'
```

Select security groups by name, or another tag (all criteria must match):
```
 securityGroupSelector:
   Name: my-security-group
   MySecurityTag: '' # matches all resources with the tag
```

Select security groups by name using a wildcard:
```
 securityGroupSelector:
   Name: "*Public*"
```

Specify security groups explicitly by ID:
```yaml
 securityGroupSelector:
   aws-ids: "sg-063d7acfb4b06c82c,sg-06e0cf9c198874591"
```

### Tags

Karpenter adds tags to all resources it creates, including EC2 Instances, EBS volumes, and Launch Templates. The default set of AWS tags are listed below.

```
Name: karpenter.sh/provisioner/<provisioner-name>
karpenter.sh/provisioner-name: <provisioner-name>
kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-name>: owned
```

Additional tags can be added in the provider tags section which are merged with and can override the default tag values.
```
spec:
  provider:
    tags:
      InternalAccountingTag: 1234
      dev.corp.net/app: Calculator
      dev.corp.net/team: MyTeam
```

### Metadata Options

Control the exposure of [Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html) on EC2 Instances launched by this provisioner using a generated launch template.

Refer to [recommended, security best practices](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/iam/#restrict-access-to-the-instance-profile-assigned-to-the-worker-node) for limiting exposure of Instance Metadata and User Data to pods.

If metadataOptions are omitted from this provisioner, the following default settings will be used.

```
spec:
  provider:
    metadataOptions:
      httpEndpoint: enabled
      httpProtocolIPv6: disabled
      httpPutResponseHopLimit: 2
      httpTokens: required
```

### Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Family

The AMI used when provisioning nodes can be controlled by the `amiFamily` field. Based on the value set for `amiFamily`, Karpenter will automatically query for the appropriate [EKS optimized AMI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-amis.html) via AWS Systems Manager (SSM). 

Currently, Karpenter supports `amiFamily` values `AL2`, `Bottlerocket`, and `Ubuntu`. GPUs are only supported with `AL2` and `Bottlerocket`.

Note: If a custom launch template is specified, then the AMI value in the launch template is used rather than the `amiFamily` value.


```
spec:
  provider:
    amiFamily: Bottlerocket
```

### Block Device Mappings 

The `blockDeviceMappings` field in a Provisioner can be used to control the Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes that Karpenter attaches to provisioned nodes. Karpenter uses default block device mappings for the AMI Family specified. For example, the `Bottlerocket` AMI Family defaults with two block device mappings, one for Bottlerocket's control volume and the other for container resources such as images and logs. 

Learn more about [block device mappings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html).

Note: If a custom launch template is specified, then the `BlockDeviceMappings` field in the launch template is used rather than the provisioner's `blockDeviceMappings`.

```
spec:
  provider:
    blockDeviceMappings:
      - deviceName: /dev/xvda
        ebs:
          volumeSize: 100Gi
          volumeType: gp3
          iops: 10000
          encrypted: true
          kmsKeyID: "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
          deleteOnTermination: true
          throughput: 125
          snapshotID: snap-0123456789
```

## Other Resources

### Accelerators, GPU

Accelerator (e.g., GPU) values include
- `nvidia.com/gpu`
- `amd.com/gpu`
- `aws.amazon.com/neuron`

Karpenter supports accelerators, such as GPUs.


Additionally, include a resource requirement in the workload manifest. This will cause the GPU dependent pod will be scheduled onto the appropriate node.

*Accelerator resource in workload manifest (e.g., pod)*

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - resources:
          limits:
            nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
```
